        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Interface Metrics</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center; padding:3%;">Interfaces are communication points between different systems or devices, such as network interfaces that allow data exchange between computers and networks. Understanding interface metrics helps in monitoring performance, identifying potential issues, and optimizing resource use. Metrics such as data sent/received, errors, and speed provide insights into the efficiency and health of the interface. By tracking these metrics, you can detect problems like network congestion, hardware failures, or security risks, ensuring smooth system operation. Regularly analyzing interface metrics also helps in proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.</p>
